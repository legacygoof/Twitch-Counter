# Twitch-Counter

# Summary:
  I created twitch-counter in my free time because I was unable to find any assisted counters out there to make it easier to
  show my wins or losses on stream. I figured i might as well make one and it was a lot more complex than i actually thought
  it was going to be. Anyways, with Twitch-Counter your able to create your own counters for games and set binds to increase or
  decrease the value of the counter. you can have a win-loss counter or a kill-death counter. All counters are saved to there own
  text file and you can use that text file for your stream.
  
  **How To Use:**
  + Create counter
  + Set binds
  + Select counter you want to use by clicking on it in the left list box
  + Right click on selected counter to edit or remove it.
  + Right text box shows what the counter will say on stream
  + use Num-Pad + and Num-Pad - to increase and decrease values of selected counter variable
  
  Example:
  
  + Name: Win-Loss Counter
  + Format: Wins: $c1 - Loss: $c2
  
  + Text-On-Stream: Wins: 2 - Loss: 4
  
  + CounterOneBind: numpad7
  + CounterTwoBind: numpad8
  
  + To select counter one to increase or decrease press numpad7 and use numpad + or - to increase or decrease its value and it will update the text file in real time
